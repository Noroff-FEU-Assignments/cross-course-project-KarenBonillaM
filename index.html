    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would say. Firstly, it is important to sanitize user input. Making sure the data is in the right form, will prevent webpages being vulnerable against threats like SQL injections. Secondly, never trust everything that the server sends. It is crucial to use a strong Content Security Policy. Thirdly, make your passwords uncrackable, considering two factor authentication for the site. Fourthly use HTTPS instead HTTP. HTTPS encrypts data sent between the client and the server. Finally, continues deployment and keeping the website update are some of the main practice to keep a site safe.</p>
